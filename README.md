# OpenCV 3 Samples
I wanted to create some very simple OpenCV apps just showcase a few simple image processing calls with some basic encapsulation.

There's a C++ and a python sample.

Feel free to use these as templates. Go nuts!

## Getting Started
You'll want to install OpenCV 3

I personally use brew:
```
brew install opencv3
```

Once you've set that up, then you should be able to build/run these samples.
